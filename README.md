# CV-Vision-Transformers
UMARV Computer Vision Team for development and reseearch of applying vision transformers (ViT) to segment and detect objects and areas of interest.


# Places to Start
1. Start from scratch and develop architecture in PyTorch/TensorFlow. This can  (Advanced)
   a. TransUNet
   b. SETR (SEgmentation TRansformer)
   c. So many others
2. Fine-Tune 




# Things to Consider
1. Large amounts of data are needed to train ViTs from scratch. Looks for opportunites to fine-tune existing models or use transfer learning
2. The Sim can be used to artificially gather large amounts of data
3. Large AV datasets can also be used here to create a general model that we can gather our necessary data from
